// In this file, you can add custom mutations for your seeding script.
// If you've added codegen to your Amplify project, the seed file in this directory will try to import the auto-generated mutations automatically.
// In that case, this file can be used to add additional custom mutations to complement the mutations from codegen.
// Typically they would reside in your "src/graphql" folder
